## Vulnerability Assessment Assignment 

This repository contains my vulnerability assessment report for the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification Program.

## Contents
- Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Scope
The assessment covers the current access controls of the system for a period of three months, from June 2023 to August 2023.

## Purpose
Secure the database server due to its critical role in marketing operations.

## Remediation Strategy
The focus will be on implementing authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms.

# Vulnerability Assessment Report

## System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It operates on the latest version of the Linux operating system and is configured with a MySQL database management system. The system has a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and features SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

## Scope
This assessment is based on the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 guide to risk analysis for the information system, covering the period from June to August 2023.

## Purpose
The database server plays a pivotal role in storing customer, campaign, and analytic data. These datasets are instrumental for tracking performance and customizing marketing efforts.

## Risk Assessment

| Threat Source | Threat Event                                 | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|----------|------|
| Hacker       | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration|      3     |    3     |  9   |
| Employee     | Disrupt mission-critical operations          |      2     |    3     |  6   |
| Customer     | Alter/Delete critical information            |      1     |    3     |  3   |

## Approach
Risks evaluated consider the data storage and management procedures. We pinpointed potential threat sources and events based on the likelihood of a security incident, considering the open access permissions of the information system. Incident severities were then contrasted against operational impacts.

## Remediation Strategy
The main strategy revolves around:
- Employing strong authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms.
- Utilizing strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication.
- Encrypting data in transit with TLS.
- IP allow-listing for corporate offices to deter unauthorized external access.
